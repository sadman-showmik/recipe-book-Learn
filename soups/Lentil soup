## Instructions

1. **Sauté the Vegetables:**  
   - In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for 5–6 minutes until softened.  

2. **Add Garlic and Spices:**  
   - Stir in the garlic, cumin, coriander, paprika, and thyme. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.  

3. **Add Lentils and Broth:**  
   - Add the rinsed lentils, broth, tomatoes, and bay leaf. Stir well and bring the mixture to a boil.  

4. **Simmer:**  
   - Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 25–30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.  

5. **Blend (Optional):**  
   - For a creamier texture, blend a portion of the soup using an immersion blender (or carefully in a blender), then return it to the pot.  

6. **Season and Finish:**  
   - Remove the bay leaf. Stir in lemon juice (if using), and adjust salt and pepper to taste.  

7. **Serve:**  
   - Ladle into bowls, garnish with fresh parsley
